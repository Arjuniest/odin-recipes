<h2>Description</h2>
<p> Jhal muri is an Indian street food/chaat made in Kolkata with puffed rice("Muri"), boiled potato, chopped onions, fresh cucumber, tomatoes, green chillies, coconut, sprouted Bengal gram, etc. All of this is seasoned with a special jhal muri moshla (spice mix), generous sprinkling of pungent mustard oil, and black salt. Jhal muri sellers set up their shops outside schools, colleges, railway stations, parksâ€”anywhere that people need a light, affordable evening snack. Our favourite jhal muris are those served on trains during long journeys, by travelling vendors who board the train with their jhal muri setup, make jhal muri for the hungry (or bored) passengers, and then get off the train at another station. They keep travelling back and forth on certain routes all day selling delicious jhal muri.</p>
